This currently incorporate very rudimentary text clustering https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-easily-cluster-textual-data-in-python-ab27040b07d8

To Do:
* Start with just reading first 5 pages and wrapping into clean functions. Can parallelize these calls.
* Clean up the prompt and API call

* Wrap application into an API and deploy on server
  * Start with inputting URL
* Build front end that makes the API call
  * Probably can't get time under 10 seconds - set up progress bar animation that progresses based on steps

* Parallelize website scraping
* Add in clustering to functions
* refine text clustering method 
* Do search from front end
